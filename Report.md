# Assignment-Decision-Tree-Classification
## Introduction:

- Briefly introduce the problem statement and the dataset used for analysis.

## Data Preprocessing:

- Loaded customer data from the 'customer_data.csv' file.
- Encoded categorical variables ('Gender' and 'Marital Status') using one-hot encoding.
- Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio.

## Model Training:

- Utilized Random Forest Classifier for predictive modeling.
- Trained the model using the training data (X_train, y_train).

## Model Evaluation:

- Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of accuracy_score_value.
- Precision: The precision of the model is precision_score_value.
- Recall: The recall score of the model is recall_score_value.
- F1-score: The F1-score of the model is f1_score_value.
- Discussed the significance of these metrics in evaluating the model's performance.

## Final Results
- Accuracy: 1.0
- Precision: 1.0
- Recall: 1.0
- F1-score: 1.0
